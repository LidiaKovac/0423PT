Across the river from the North End (Little Italy), we live in a safe, cohesive neighborhood with its own distinct maritime flavor, yet within a 15-20 min walk to downtown.  Charlestown has its own bars and restaurants, but is mostly known for its role in the Revolutionary War.  We live on Bunker Hill, the monument is visible from the back of our house.  Our local pub, the Warren Tavern is older than the United States.  Nearby Old Ironsides is the oldest boat in the fleet.  Todd English's restaurant Figs is just a few blocks away.  I take my daughter for walks on the docks or into parks in Cambridge.  Whole Foods is 5 min walk away.  TD Garden is about 20 min walk away.
